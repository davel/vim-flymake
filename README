DESCRIPTION:
  Performs on-the-fly syntax checks of the files being edited
  using the external syntax check tool (usually the compiler).
  Highlights erroneous lines and displays associated error
  and warning messages. This plugin is a port of 'flymake-mode'
  for Emacs.

INSTALL:
  1. put flymake.vim into your plugin directory (~/.vim/plugin)
  2. put some file-type plugins into yours (~/.vim/ftplugin)

I've never written a vim plugin and this is the first project.
Please hack it and distribute freely under the BSD3 license.

HINT:
  To use flymake.vim (the first version), you have two hooks:
  
  1. autocmd BufWritePost * :call FlyMake(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  2. autocmd BufWinLeave  * :call FlyMakeCloseWindows()

  Here, the FlyMake function takes 3 arguments:

  arg1 : the external command to check syntax; which consists
         of the format of printf. arg1 must have two '%s':
         one is for a temporary directory
         another is for a program file (without path name)


  arg2 : a pattern match for error message. arg2 must have two
         groupings:
         one is a line number for where is error occurred
         another is a message for error message

  arg3 : a pattern match for warning message, like arg2.

  See examples in the ftplugin directory for hacking.
